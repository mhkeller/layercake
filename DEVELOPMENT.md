# Layer Cake Development

## Project Structure

The main `LayerCake` library which you get when you

```js
  import { LayerCake} from 'layercake';
```

is in `src/lib`.

The Layer Cake library doesn't include chart components, instead example components that live inside of the projects are presented on the Layer Cake website, where they can be downloaded or tried out in the Svelte Playground.

The example components are in `src/_components`.

Their basic structure and properties are demonstrated on their respective pages in `src/routes/_components` and `src/routes/components_ssr`.

Further examples using combinations of the components are in `src/routes/_examples` and `src/routes/_examples_ssr`.

The actual loading of these pages happens in `src/routes/components`, `src/routes/examples` and `src/routes/examples-ssr` where the Markdown descriptions from `src/content` and code files are combined.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Unit tests using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) are in `test/lib` and can be run with

```sh
npm run test:lib
```

### End-to-End Tests

To test more complex interactions of the website and rendering of documentation and the display of components [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is used.

```sh
npm run test:playwright
```

There are YAML-based ARIA snapshots of component property tables as well as screenshots of rendered components on the various pages.

They can be updated with

```sh
npm run test:init:snapshots
```

To have better matching between the CI environment and the saved screenshots they can be updated through a CI action (in `.github/workflows/update-snapshots.yml`), for example after a component's defaults have changed.

The actions can be triggered to run on a branch by going to <https://github.com/mhkeller/layercake/actions/workflows/update-snapshots.yml> (or in a fork) and selecting the respective branch in the `Run workflow` button.
