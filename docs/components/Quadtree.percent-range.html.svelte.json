{"main":{"slug":"Quadtree.percent-range.html.svelte","contents":"<!--\n  @component\n  Creates an interaction layer (in HTML) using [d3-quadtree](https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree) to find the nearest datapoint to the mouse. This component creates a slot that exposes variables `x`, `y`, `found` (the found datapoint), `visible` (a Boolean whether any data was found) and `e` (the event object). This component works with a percent range so the `x` and `y` values coming back will be percentages.\n\n  The quadtree searches across both the x and y dimensions at the same time. But if you want to only search across one, set the `x` and `y` props to the same value. For example, the [shared tooltip component](https://layercake.graphics/components/SharedTooltip.html.svelte) sets `y='x'` since it's nicer behavior to only pick up on the nearest x-value.\n -->\n<script>\n  import { getContext } from 'svelte';\n  import { quadtree } from 'd3-quadtree';\n\n  const { data, xGet, yGet, width, height } = getContext('LayerCake');\n\n  let visible = false;\n  let found = {};\n  let e = {};\n\n  /** @type {String} [x='x'] - The dimension to search across when moving the mouse left and right. */\n  export let x = 'x';\n\n  /** @type {String} [y='y'] - The dimension to search across when moving the mouse up and down. */\n  export let y = 'y';\n\n  /** @type {String} [searchRadius] - The number of pixels to search around the mouse's location.
